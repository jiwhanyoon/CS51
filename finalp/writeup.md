## Results & Discussion:

### Stage 1: done by simply understanding the pattern that whenever an expression occured, call the recursive function itself. The base cases were carefully defined to make sure that variables, numbers, and booleans were all supported.



```

### Stage 2: Finding free variables by creating the list and using the last page of the spec sheet to understand the different cases for Fun, Let, and Letrec. It was all about understanding the union and differences of sets.




```

### Stage 3: Substitution was also about the last sheet of the pdf and understanding the different subcases underneath fun, let, and letrec. 



```


### Evals : It was quite difficult to tracking the dynmaical and lexical scoping differences for evaluations. Understanidng that substitution and evaluations happen throughout.
